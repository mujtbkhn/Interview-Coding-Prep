// Implement four quadrants (just like the Microsoft logo) using react with reusability. And after that, whenever I click on a box, it should show clicked on that particular box, and when I click on another box it should show clicked in that box and disappear in another box. ( without any code redundancy)

import React, { useState } from 'react'

const Quadrants = () => {
   
    return (
        <div>
           

        </div>
    )
}

export default Quadrants
