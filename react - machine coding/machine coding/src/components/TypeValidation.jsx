// Create a reusable input component that will accept type as a prop and will do different types of input validation(if the type is text it should contain max x no. of characters if a type is a number it should be between x and y etc.) depending upon the type we passed. As soon as something invalid is entered, an error should dynamically show on screen and as soon as we change it to something valid, the error should also disappear.

import React, { useState } from 'react'

const TypeValidation = ({ type }) => {

    return (
        <div>

        </div>
    )
}

export default TypeValidation
